Personal website for auu
Project started 2024-10-22

Based on official Django tutorial -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/

Created with uv. This means that wherever the instructions say to execute e.g. `python manage.py runserver` I actually ran `uv run manage.py runserver`

#### Tutorial 1

Create a new view
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/

- Created the directory with `django-admin startproject hello au-django-proj`
- Tested the server with `uv run manage.py runserver`
- Created an app with `uv run manage.py startapp polls`
- Created a simple view by adding the `index` function to `polls/views.py` that returns an `HttpResponse`
- Created a URLconf by creating `polls/urls.py` and populating the list `urlpatterns` with the `path` function
- Linked the polls URLconf to the global URLconf by editing `hello/urls.py`, adding a new `path` to `urlpatterns` with an include for `"polls.urls"`
- Tested the server again and saw that my dummy view is visible at `127.0.0.1:8000/polls`

#### Tutorial 2

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial02/

- Checked out `hello/settings.py` which hosts an extensive list of settings, including `INSTALLED_APPS`, which comes with a bunch of official Django apps by default.
- Set the `TIME_ZONE` in `hello/settings.py`
- Ran `uv run manage.py migrate` to initialise the database with all the apps named in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Edited `polls/models.py` to create two new classes representing the Question model and Choice model. These classes had attributes that used the `django.db.models` module to define how they will be stored in the database.
- Edited the list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in `hello/settings.py` to add `polls.apps.PollsConfig`.
- Ran `uv run manage.py makemigrations polls` to create a migration for our new poll. We could just `migrate` but this way we can peer closer at the workings. Note that the created migration is the file `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py`.
- Print out the SQL generated by the migration using `uv run manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001`. It's a short SQL script that performs `CREATE TABLE` for each model and programs in the constraints we described.
- Ran  `uv run manage.py migrate` to execute the migration.
- Ran `uv run manage.py shell` to open the Python shell in a context that lets us interact with our models:
    - Created a new `Question` object with a `question_text` and `pub_date`
    - Executed its `.save()` method to save it to the database
    - Checked its `.id`, `.question_text` and `.pub_date` attributes
    - Changed the question text and re-saved
    - Called the `Question.objects.all()` method to list all the questions in the DB.
- Realised we forgot to add a `__str__` method to our model classes so we go back and do that in `polls/models.py`
- Added the `was_published_recently()` method to `Question` just to play around with
- Continued to play in the shell. Created a question and assigned it several choices.
    - We used `q.choice_set.create(...)` and `q.choice_set.all()` to set and get the list of choices associated with a question.
    - We saw methods like `q.choice_set.filter` and `Questions.objects.filter` and how they had auto generated fields such as `choice_text__startswith` and `pub_date__year`.
- Used `uv run manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin account
- Logged into `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` with the admin account and checked out the portal
- Edited `polls/admin.py` to `admin.site.register(Question)` register the Question app. Now it shows up on the admin panel. We can go to `127.0.0.1:8000/admin/polls/questions` and use a nice interface to create and edit Questions.


#### Tutorial 3

```
A view is a “type” of web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template. For example, in a blog application, you might have the following views:
- Blog homepage – displays the latest few entries.
- Entry “detail” page – permalink page for a single entry.
